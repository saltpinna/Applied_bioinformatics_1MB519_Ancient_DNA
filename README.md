## Scripts
Following are brief descriptions of all scripts in the repository

### Incrementalstatistics

### find_telomere
Finds the last chromosome position of the telomere in a FASTA sequence file, where telomeres are denoted as a sequence of 'N's in the beginning of the FASTA sequence

### gene_nongene_depth_comparison
Returns two files of sequence depth values for windows in genic regions and intergenic regions respectively, based on a reference genome FASTA file and gene position information in that reference
